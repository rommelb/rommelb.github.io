## Overview of steps required

There are only three simple steps, so using **Beautiful Jekyll** is *literally* as easy as 1-2-3 :)    

Here is a 40-second video showing how to get started, with the specific steps below.  For a more complete installation guide, [visit the Beautiful Jekyll page](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme).

### 1. Fork the Beautiful Jekyll repository

Fork the [repository](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner in GitHub.

### 2. Rename the repository to `yourusername.github.io`

This will create a GitHub User page ready with the **Beautiful Jekyll** template that will be available at http://yourusername.github.io (sometimes it takes a few minutes).

### 3. Customize settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site.  The settings in the file are fairly self-explanatory and I added comments inside the file to help you further.  Every time you make a change to any file, your website will get rebuilt and should be updated at `yourusername.github.io` within a minute.

You can now visit your shiny new website, which will be seeded with several sample blog posts and a couple other pages.

See how easy that is? I wasn't lying - it really can be done in two minutes.
